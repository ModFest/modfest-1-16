**ModFest 1.16** was a mod development jam that ran from June 12th through June 25th, 2020.

This modpack contains all submissions, as well as a showcase world built by participants to show off their mods!

**Key Features**:
- Witness the dawn of 42 mods, including **Glowcase**, **Astromine**, **Haema**, and **Heart of the Machine**!
- Explore sprawling vanilla terrain with mod "booths" scattered near, far, and _very_ far!
- Cycle on bike trails and around a map covered in light bridges, named locations, and floating text!
- Hop between any booth at will using the mod hub!
- Get hopelessly lost!
